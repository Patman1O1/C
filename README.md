A hub for all my personal projects written in C. Projects are divided into two categories: libraries and programs. Programs are independent projects that are executable while libraries are meant to be used alongside programs. For C, libraries are further divided into two categories: static and shared. Static libraries get linked to the main executable (i.e program) at compile which is ideal for situtations requiring minimal runtime overhead. Shared libraries get linked to the executable at runtime and is suitable for large libraries where copying the entire source code would be cumbersome. Not much is here right now. I plan on doing more C project when the semester is over.
